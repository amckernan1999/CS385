What I liked about this animation was how all of the balls were periodically accelarated and slowed down over time. It really gave the graphic a sense of dynamic movemenent. It 
was also really interesting to look at all of the other animations and see how invovled the actual code was. I found myself suprised at the complexity or simplicity of different 
animations. Specifically that some animations I thought would be simple had complex implementations, and others I thought might be more involced were simple.
